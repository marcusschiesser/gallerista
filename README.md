Gallerista
==========

Android app for viewing images from Flickr. Altough the app is still running under 2.2 it provides
a 4.x style UI.
Uses the [flickr.photos.search method](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search) to find
the images by a given keyword. Displays the images found in a GridView.
For a better UX the app is also caching already loaded images in a LRU-Cache.
To start coding, just import the project in Eclipse. Have fun!
